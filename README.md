## what is this? 
This project is a PatchFox internal library. It contains all the json entities, data wrappers, and associated utilities a java service might need to work with pipeline data. The intention is to keep this code here in an internal library so any given PatchFox Java service can import this library and have all the things it might need to work with pipeline data.
